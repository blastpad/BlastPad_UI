# BlastPad UI
A simple, lightweight and modular CSS front-end framework for styling websites quickly.



# Contributions
Contributions are most welcome. We welcome contributions of code (HTML and CSS), design, documentation, support, marketing, translation, SEO and more!



# New to Contributing?

This is a great open-source project for beginners whether you are new to programming or new to contributing to open-source projects. We have good first bugs, mentored bugs, bugs for pair programming if you need some guidance.

We also welcome contributors of all levels.

The only thing you need to know before contributing is HTML and CSS.  If you are not familiar with HTML and CSS, you can do the free 7-hour course on Codecademy at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web.

We have weekly pair programming and mentorship sessions.   Please message me to reserve your spot.
